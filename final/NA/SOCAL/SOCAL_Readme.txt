This Sector is KLAX (Socal) It includes much of Socal with Palmdale.

Ive Implemented the most essential sids and stars (all of them are not needed since some are in generally the same direction as others)
LAX, PMD, PSP, SAN, BUR, LGB, VNY, SNA, ONT, CQH, MYF, RIV, CNO, SBD, SBA, RAL, OXR, CMA, TOA, and SMO are included.
"Separation = 0" is an optional line that you can add a # infront of it to completely remove it, or just remove the line
GA Traffic is included at every aiport except LAX (this may or may not change in the future)
UAF is a place hodler icao and callsign for the us air force planes that go to March Reserve.
CNO runway 26L only has visual approaches but im using it for the landing runway as it is the longest runway and because the only runway that has an ILS is so short.
The special airlines that dont fly to these airports are uncluded under # Specials (some are ga airlines i.e Delta private jets and NetJets)
Hope you enjoy :D
